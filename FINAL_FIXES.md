# Final Session Fixes - Low Credit Summary

## Fixed in Last Hour:

1. **error-logger.js** - Created missing file
2. **initCanvasEvents()** - Added drag-drop from palette (73 lines)
3. **Connection drawing** - Fixed mousemove handler for live line drawing
4. **Docs cleanup** - Removed 8 duplicate files

## What NOW Works:

✅ Drag nodes from palette to canvas
✅ Draw connections between nodes (drag output->input)
✅ Visual feedback while dragging connections
✅ Auto-Clicker workflow loads (6 nodes)
✅ All palette nodes searchable

## Still Needs Testing:

- Workflow execution
- Python agent
- Load/Save workflows
- Undo/Redo
